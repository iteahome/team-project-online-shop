- Misu:
    -   Added documentation comments to the code, for better legibility;
    -   Added "problem" comments (in all-caps) where I didn't understand or like the code's logic;
    -   Modified some messages that are printed for the user;
    -   Reordered the user parameter sequence to always be userName-password-email-phoneNo for better maintenance,
        including the sequence in which these parameters are asked for in SignUp;
    -   Reorganized some code (see "FindAllUsers()" method) for better understandability;
    -   Specified generic type for cart ArrayList (i.e. <Product>)
    -   Added no-argument constructors to the exceptions that didn't have one.
